# Slot-machine 
I got recommendations from Emre and picked SLOT MACHINE. Because that's the only one I was familiar with. I think it's better to start the journey with something I have known a little.

# Technologies used: 
HTML, CSS(transition), Javascript(Promise)

1. Input your name to start to play. If there's no input, the game will not start.

2. You can reset the game anytime with input name to restart the game.

3. Click the START button to PLAY. You will have three chances to win.

4. If all three icons are the same, you win. Otherwise you can keep playing.

5. If you have used up all three chances and not won, the game is over.

6. Click the reset button to restart.

7. When using a smaller screen, the screen size is fixed.

8. Every result generated will be stored to localStorage for score tracking and future data analysis purposes.
