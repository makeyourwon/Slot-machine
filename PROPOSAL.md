# Project Proposal - Slot machine


## Project Description 

My app is called Slot machine. The player will have 3 chances to play. Only when 3 icons are the same, the player wins. If player doesn't get the jackpot in the first time, the player can continue pressing the play button until the chances used up. Then the game stop working unless the game is reset.
